# Breaking bad #

[App](https://vvaleri.github.io/breakingbad/) about characters of "Breaking bad".
I used React and Styled components for the first time. So I learned about what the SPA looks like and how to get data from [API](https://www.breakingbadapi.com/).

I love this show and created own collection of quotes (and button with fly. the fly! do you get it?).
